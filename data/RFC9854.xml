    <abstract>
      <t>Route discovery for symmetric and asymmetric Peer-to-Peer (P2P) traffic flows is a desirable feature in Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). For that purpose, this document specifies AODV-RPL -- the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) based on Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing. AODV-RPL is a reactive P2P route discovery mechanism for both hop-by-hop routes and source routing. Paired instances are used to construct directional paths for cases where there are asymmetric links between source and target nodes.</t>
