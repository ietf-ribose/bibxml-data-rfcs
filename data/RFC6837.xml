      <t>The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a protocol to encapsulate IP packets in order to allow end sites to route to one another without injecting routes from one end of the Internet to another.  This memo presents an experimental database and a discussion of methods to transport the mapping of Endpoint IDs (EIDs) to Routing Locators (RLOCs) to routers in a reliable, scalable, and secure manner.  Our analysis concludes that transport of all EID-to- RLOC mappings scales well to at least 10^8 entries.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>
