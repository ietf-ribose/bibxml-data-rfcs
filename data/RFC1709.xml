    <abstract>The K-12 community traditionally has not had this level of staffing available for telecommunications planning.  This document is intended to bridge that gap and provides a recommended technical direction, an introduction to the role the Internet now plays in K-12 education and technical guidelines for building a campus data communications infrastructure that provides internetworking services and connections to the Internet.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</abstract>
