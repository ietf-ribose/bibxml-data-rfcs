    <abstract>
      <t>This RFC reproduces the material from the "front pages" of the National Research Council report resulting from a study of the DOD Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in comparison with the ISO Internet Protocol (ISO-IP) and Transport Protocol level 4 (TP-4).  The point of this RFC is to make the text of the Executive Summary widely available in a timely way.  The order of presentation has been altered, and the pagination changed.  This RFC is distributed for information only.  This RFC does not establish any policy for the DARPA research community or the DDN operational community.</t>
