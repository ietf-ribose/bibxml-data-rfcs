      <t>This memo specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an interior gateway protocol (IGP) to support TCP/IP as well as OSI.  This allows a single routing protocol to be used to support pure IP environments, pure OSI environments, and dual environments.  This specification was developed by the IS-IS working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
