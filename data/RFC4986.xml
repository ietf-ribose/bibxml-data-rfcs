    <abstract>Every DNS security-aware resolver must have at least one Trust Anchor to use as the basis for validating responses from DNS signed zones.  For various reasons, most DNS security-aware resolvers are expected to have several Trust Anchors.  For some operations, manual monitoring and updating of Trust Anchors may be feasible, but many operations will require automated methods for updating Trust Anchors in their security-aware resolvers.  This document identifies the requirements that must be met by an automated DNS Trust Anchor rollover solution for security-aware DNS resolvers.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
