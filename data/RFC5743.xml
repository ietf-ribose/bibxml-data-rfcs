    <abstract>This memo defines the publication stream for RFCs from the Internet Research Task Force.  Most documents undergoing this process will come from IRTF Research Groups, and it is expected that they will be published as Informational or Experimental RFCs by the RFC Editor.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
