    <abstract>
      <t>Because the Internet forwards packets according to the IP destination address, packet forwarding typically takes place without inspection of the source address and malicious attacks have been launched using spoofed source addresses.  In an effort to enhance the Internet with IP source address validation, a prototype implementation of the IP Source Address Validation Architecture (SAVA) was created and an evaluation was conducted on an IPv6 network.  This document reports on the prototype implementation and the test results, as well as the lessons and insights gained from experimentation.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>
