    <abstract>
      <t>Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms provide both confidentiality and integrity of data. The widespread use of AEAD algorithms in various applications has led to an increased demand for AEAD algorithms with additional properties, driving research in the field. This document provides definitions for the most common of those properties and aims to improve consistency in the terminology used in documentation. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group.</t>
