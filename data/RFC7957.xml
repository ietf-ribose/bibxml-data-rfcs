    <abstract>RFC 5727 defined several processes for the former Real-time Applications and Infrastructure (RAI) area.  These processes include the evolution of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related protocols, as well as the operation of the DISPATCH and SIPCORE working groups.  This document updates RFC 5727 to allow flexibility for the area and working group structure, while preserving the SIP change processes.  It also generalizes the DISPATCH working group processes so that they can be easily adopted by other working groups.</abstract>
