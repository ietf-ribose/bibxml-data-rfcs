    <abstract>Since the initial revelations of pervasive surveillance in 2013, several classes of attacks on Internet communications have been discovered.  In this document, we develop a threat model that describes these attacks on Internet confidentiality.  We assume an attacker that is interested in undetected, indiscriminate eavesdropping.  The threat model is based on published, verified attacks.</abstract>
