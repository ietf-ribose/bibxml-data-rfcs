    <abstract>This memo describes the Finger User Information Protocol.  This is a simple protocol which provides an interface to a remote user information program.  Based on RFC 742, a description of the original Finger protocol, this memo attempts to clarify the expected communication between the two ends of a Finger connection.  It also tries not to invalidate the many existing implementations or add unnecessary restrictions to the original protocol definition.  This edition corrects and clarifies in a minor way, RFC 1194.
