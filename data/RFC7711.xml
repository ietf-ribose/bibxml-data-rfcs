    <abstract>
      <t>Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments.  As a result, domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain.  Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security.  This document defines methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols.  Although these methods were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols.</t>
