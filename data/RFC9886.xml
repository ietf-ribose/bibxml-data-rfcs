    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the Domain Name System (DNS) functionality of a Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Identity Management Entity (DIME). It is built around DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) to standardize a hierarchical registry structure and associated processes to facilitate trustable and scalable registration and lookup of information related to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The registry system supports issuance, discovery, and verification of DETs, enabling secure identification and association of UAS and their operators. It also defines the interactions between different classes of registries (root, organizational, and individual) and their respective roles in maintaining the integrity of the registration data. This architecture enables decentralized, federated operation while supporting privacy, traceability, and regulatory compliance requirements in the context of UAS Remote Identification and other services.</t>
