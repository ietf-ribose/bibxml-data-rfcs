    <abstract>This document specifies the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) extensions necessary to support link state routing for any protocols running directly over Layer-2.  While supporting this concept involves several pieces, this document only describes extensions to IS-IS.  Furthermore, the Type, Length, Value pairs (TLVs) described in this document are generic Layer-2 additions, and specific ones as needed are defined in the IS-IS technology-specific extensions.  We leave it to the systems using these IS-IS extensions to explain how the information carried in IS-IS is used. [STANDARDS- TRACK]</abstract>
