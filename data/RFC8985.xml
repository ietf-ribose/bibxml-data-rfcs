      <t>This document presents the RACK-TLP loss detection algorithm for TCP.  RACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamps and selective acknowledgments (SACKs) and has two parts.  Recent Acknowledgment (RACK) starts fast recovery quickly using time-based inferences derived from acknowledgment (ACK) feedback, and Tail Loss Probe (TLP) leverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK feedback to avoid retransmission timeout (RTO) events.  Compared to the widely used duplicate acknowledgment (DupAck) threshold approach, RACK-TLP detects losses more efficiently when there are application-limited flights of data, lost retransmissions, or data packet reordering events.  It is intended to be an alternative to the DupAck threshold approach.</t>
