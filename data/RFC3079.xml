    <abstract>This document describes the method used to derive initial MPPE session keys from a variety of credential types.  It is expected that this memo will be updated whenever Microsoft defines a new key derivation method for MPPE, since its primary purpose is to provide an open, easily accessible reference for third-parties wishing to interoperate with Microsoft products.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
