    <abstract>
      <t>This document reproduces the Host/Host Protocol developed by the ARPA Network Working Group during 1969, 1970, and 1971.  It describes a protocol used to manage communication between processes residing on independent Hosts.  It addresses issues of multiplexing multiple streams of communication (including addressing, flow control, connection establishment/disestablishment, and other signaling) over a single hardware interface.  It was the official protocol of the ARPA Network from January 1972 until the switch to TCP/IP in January 1983.  It is offered as an RFC at this late date to help complete the historical record available through the RFC series.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for the historical record.</t>
