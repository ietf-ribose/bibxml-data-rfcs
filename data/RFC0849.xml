    <abstract>This RFC actually is a request for comments.  The issue dealt with is that of a naming registry update procedure, both as exists currently and what could exist in the future.  None of the proposed solutions are intended as standards at this time; rather it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as the appropriate solution, leaving eventually to the adoption of standards.</abstract>
