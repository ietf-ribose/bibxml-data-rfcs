      <t>Internet communications and applications have both environmental costs and benefits. The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 to explore and understand these impacts.</t>
      <t>The role of the workshop was to discuss the impacts and the evolving industry needs, and to identify areas for improvements and future work. A key goal of the workshop was to call further attention to the topic and bring together a diverse stakeholder community to discuss these issues.</t>
