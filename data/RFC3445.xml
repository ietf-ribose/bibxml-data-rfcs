    <abstract>
      <t>This document limits the Domain Name System (DNS) KEY Resource Record (RR) to only keys used by the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  The original KEY RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC keys and arbitrary application keys.  Storing both DNSSEC and application keys with the same record type is a mistake.  This document removes application keys from the KEY record by redefining the Protocol Octet field in the KEY RR Data.  As a result of removing application keys, all but one of the flags in the KEY record become unnecessary and are redefined.  Three existing application key sub-types are changed to reserved, but the format of the KEY record is not changed.  This document updates RFC 2535. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
