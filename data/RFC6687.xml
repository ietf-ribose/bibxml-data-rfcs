    <abstract>This document presents a performance evaluation of the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for a small outdoor deployment of sensor nodes and for a large-scale smart meter network.  Detailed simulations are carried out to produce several routing performance metrics using these real-life deployment scenarios.  Please refer to the PDF version of this document, which includes several plots for the performance metrics not shown in the plain-text version.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
