    <abstract>The TCP-MD5 option is most commonly used to secure BGP sessions between routers.  However, changing the long-term key is difficult, since the change needs to be synchronized between different organizations.  We describe single-ended strategies that will permit (mostly) unsynchronized key changes.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
