    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies protocol stacks for the routing and transport of per-flow signalling messages along the path taken by that flow through the network.  The design uses existing transport and security protocols under a common messaging layer, the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST), which provides a common service for diverse signalling applications.  GIST does not handle signalling application state itself, but manages its own internal state and the configuration of the underlying transport and security protocols to enable the transfer of messages in both directions along the flow path.  The combination of GIST and the lower layer transport and security protocols provides a solution for the base protocol component of the "Next Steps in Signalling" (NSIS) framework.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>
