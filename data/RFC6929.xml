    <abstract>The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is nearing exhaustion of its current 8-bit Attribute Type space.  In addition, experience shows a growing need for complex grouping, along with attributes that can carry more than 253 octets of data.  This document defines changes to RADIUS that address all of the above problems.</abstract>
