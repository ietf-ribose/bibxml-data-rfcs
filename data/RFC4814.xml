    <abstract>Test engineers take pains to declare all factors that affect a given measurement, including intended load, packet length, test duration, and traffic orientation.  However, current benchmarking practice overlooks two factors that have a profound impact on test results.  First, existing methodologies do not require the reporting of addresses or other test traffic contents, even though these fields can affect test results.  Second, "stuff" bits and bytes inserted in test traffic by some link-layer technologies add significant and variable overhead, which in turn affects test results.  This document describes the effects of these factors; recommends guidelines for test traffic contents; and offers formulas for determining the probability of bit- and byte-stuffing in test traffic.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
