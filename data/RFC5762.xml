    <abstract>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a widely used transport for real-time multimedia on IP networks.  The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport protocol that provides desirable services for real-time applications.  This memo specifies a mapping of RTP onto DCCP, along with associated signalling, such that real- time applications can make use of the services provided by DCCP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
