      <t>This document describes a widely-implemented URI scheme, as World-Wide Web browsers are starting to appear on a variety of consumer electronic devices, such as television sets and television set-top boxes, which are capable of receiving television programming from either terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast, or cable.  In this context there is a need to reference television broadcasts using the URI format described in RFC 2396.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
