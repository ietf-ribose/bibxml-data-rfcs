    <abstract>This document provides some analysis of threats against the Geopriv protocol architecture.  It focuses on protocol threats, threats that result from the storage of data by entities in the architecture, and threats posed by the abuse of information yielded by Geopriv.  Some security properties that meet these threats are enumerated as a reference for Geopriv requirements.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
