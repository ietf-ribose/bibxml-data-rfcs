    <abstract>The URLFETCH command defined as part of URLAUTH provides a mechanism for third parties to gain access to data held within messages in a user's private store; however, this data is sent verbatim, which is not suitable for a number of applications.  This memo specifies a method for obtaining data in forms suitable for non-mail applications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
