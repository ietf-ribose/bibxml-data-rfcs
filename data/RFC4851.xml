    <abstract>This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) based Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) protocol.  EAP-FAST is an EAP method that enables secure communication between a peer and a server by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel.  Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used to convey authentication related data between the peer and the EAP server.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
