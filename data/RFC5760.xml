    <abstract>This document specifies an extension to the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to use unicast feedback to a multicast sender.  The proposed extension is useful for single-source multicast sessions such as Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) communication where the traditional model of many-to-many group communication is either not available or not desired.  In addition, it can be applied to any group that might benefit from a sender-controlled summarized reporting mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
