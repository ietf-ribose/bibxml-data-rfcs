      <t>Over the last two decades, many efforts have been devoted to developing solutions for mobility support over the global Internet, resulting in a variety of proposed solutions.  We conducted a systematic survey of the previous efforts to gain an overall understanding on the solution space of mobility support.  This document reports our findings and identifies remaining issues in providing ubiquitous and efficient Internet mobility support on a global scale.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
