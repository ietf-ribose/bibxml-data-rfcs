    <abstract>This document describes some of the open problems in Internet congestion control that are known today.  This includes several new challenges that are becoming important as the network grows, as well as some issues that have been known for many years.  These challenges are generally considered to be open research topics that may require more study or application of innovative techniques before Internet-scale solutions can be confidently engineered and deployed.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
