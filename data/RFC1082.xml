    <abstract>This memo suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically access mail from a discussion group server, as an extension to an earlier memo which dealt with dynamically accessing mail from a mailbox server using the Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3).  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  All of the extensions described in this memo to the POP3 are OPTIONAL.</abstract>
