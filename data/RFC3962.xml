    <abstract>The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has chosen a new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is significantly faster and (it is believed) more secure than the old Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm.  This document is a specification for the addition of this algorithm to the Kerberos cryptosystem suite. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
