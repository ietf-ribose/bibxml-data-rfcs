    <abstract>Domain Names were designed for humans, IP addresses were not.  But more than 30 years after the introduction of the DNS, a minority of mankind persists in invading the realm of machine-to-machine communication by reading, writing, misspelling, memorizing, permuting, and confusing IP addresses.  This memo describes the Internationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation ("I-DUNNO"), a notation designed to replace current textual representations of IP addresses with something that is not only more concise but will also discourage this small, but obviously important, subset of human activity.</abstract>
