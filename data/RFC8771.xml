    <abstract>
      <t>Domain Names were designed for humans, IP addresses were not.  But more than 30 years after the introduction of the DNS, a minority of mankind persists in invading the realm of machine-to-machine communication by reading, writing, misspelling, memorizing, permuting, and confusing IP addresses.
