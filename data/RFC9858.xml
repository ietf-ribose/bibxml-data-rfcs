    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends HSS/LMS (RFC 8554) by defining parameter sets that use alternative hash functions. These include hash functions that result in signatures with significantly smaller sizes than the signatures that use the RFC 8554 parameter sets and should have sufficient security.</t>
