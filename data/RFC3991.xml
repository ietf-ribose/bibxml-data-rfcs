      <t>The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) specification (RFC 3435) allows endpoints to be redirected one endpoint at a time.  This document provides extensions in the form of a new MGCP package that provides mechanisms for redirecting and resetting a group of endpoints.  It also includes the ability to more accurately redirect endpoints by allowing a list of Call Agents to be specified in a preferred order.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
