    <abstract>This document describes a key management scheme that can be used for real-time applications (both for peer-to-peer communication and group communication).  In particular, its use to support the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol is described in detail.  Security protocols for real-time multimedia applications have started to appear.  This has brought forward the need for a key management solution to support these protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
