    <abstract>This RFC proposes a set of extensions to the TCP protocol to provide efficient operation over a path with a high bandwidth*delay product.  These extensions are not proposed as an Internet standard at this time.  Instead, they are intended as a basis for further experimentation and research on transport protocol performance.</abstract>
