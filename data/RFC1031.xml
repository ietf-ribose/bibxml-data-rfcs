    <abstract>This RFC consolidates information necessary for the implementation of domain style names throughout the DDN/MILNET Internet community.  The introduction of domain style names will impact all hosts in the DDN/MILNET Internet.  This RFC is designed as an aid to implementors and administrators by providing: 1) an overview of the transition process from host tables to domains, 2) a timetable for the transition, and 3) references to documentation and software relating to the domain system.</abstract>
