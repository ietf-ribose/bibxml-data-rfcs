    <abstract>
      <t>There are many deployment scenarios that require an egress Label Switching Router (LSR) to receive binding of the Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) to an application and a payload identifier using some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism.  This document defines protocol mechanisms to address this requirement.  The procedures described in this document are equally applicable for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.
