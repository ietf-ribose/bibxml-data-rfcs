      <t>This document is a product of the work of the Multiple Interfaces Architecture Design team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.  The framework defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set of network configuration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections.</t>
