    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes web-based real-time communication use cases. Requirements on the browser functionality are derived from the use cases.</t>
      <t>This document was developed in an initial phase of the work with rather minor updates at later stages. It has not really served as a tool in deciding features or scope for the WG's efforts so far. It is being published to record the early conclusions of the WG. It will not be used as a set of rigid guidelines that specifications and implementations will be held to in the future.</t>
