    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents use cases that have a common feature that may be addressed by encoding network action indicators and associated ancillary data within MPLS packets. There is community interest in extending the MPLS data plane to carry such indicators and ancillary data to address these use cases.</t>
      <t>The use cases described in this document are not an exhaustive set but rather the ones that have been actively discussed by members of the IETF MPLS, PALS, and DetNet Working Groups from the beginning of work on MPLS Network Action (MNA) until the publication of this document.</t>
