    <abstract>On 29 August 2012, the leaders of the IEEE Standards Association, the IAB, the IETF, the Internet Society, and the W3C signed a statement affirming the importance of a jointly developed set of principles establishing a modern paradigm for global, open standards.  These principles have become known as the "OpenStand" principles.  This document contains the text of the affirmation that was signed.
