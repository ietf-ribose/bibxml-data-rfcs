    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) that was developed jointly by Cisco Systems, Inc., Nuance Communications, and Speechworks, Inc. It is published as an RFC as input for further IETF development in this area.</t>
      <t>MRCP controls media service resources like speech synthesizers, recognizers, signal generators, signal detectors, fax servers, etc., over a network. This protocol is designed to work with streaming protocols like RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), which help establish control connections to external media streaming devices, and media delivery mechanisms like RTP (Real Time Protocol). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
