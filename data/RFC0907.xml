    <abstract>This document specifies the Host Access Protocol (HAP).  Although HAP was originally designed as the network-access level protocol for the DARPA/DCA sponsored Wideband Packet Satellite Network, it is intended that it evolve into a standard interface SATNET and TACNET (aka MATNET) as well as the Wideband Network.  HAP is an experimental protocol, and will undergo further revision as new capabilities are added and/or different satellite networks are suported.  Implementations of HAP should be performed in coordination with satellite network development and operations personnel.</abstract>
