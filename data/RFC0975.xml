    <abstract>This RFC proposes enhancements to the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) to support a simple, multiple-level routing capability while preserving the robustness features of the current EGP model.  The enhancements generalize the concept of core system to include multiple communities of autonomous systems, called autonomous confederations.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.</abstract>
