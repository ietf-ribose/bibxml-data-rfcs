    <abstract>This document defines a master key used between a client of the Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) and an enforcement point, for bootstrapping lower-layer ciphering.  The master key is derived from the Master Session Key of the Extensible Authentication Protocol as a result of successful PANA authentication.  The master key guarantees cryptographic independence among enforcement points bootstrapped from PANA authentication across different address families. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
