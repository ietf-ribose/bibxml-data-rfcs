    <abstract>
      <t>This survey determines how many hosts are able to respond to TELENET connections from a user at a class C site.  This requires, in addition to IP and TCP, participation in gateway routing via ICMP and handling of Class C addresses.  The list of hosts was taken from RFC 843, extracting only those hosts which are listed there as accepting TELNET connection.  The tests were run on 18-Feb-83.</t>
