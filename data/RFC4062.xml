      <t>This document explains the terminology and concepts used in OSPF benchmarking.  Although some of these terms may be defined elsewhere (and we will refer the reader to those definitions in some cases) we include discussions concerning these terms, as they relate specifically to the tasks involved in benchmarking the OSPF protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
