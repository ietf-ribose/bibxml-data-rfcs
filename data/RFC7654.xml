    <abstract>Modern forwarding devices attempt to minimize any control- and data-plane disruptions while performing planned software changes by implementing a technique commonly known as In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU).  This document specifies a set of common methodologies and procedures designed to characterize the overall behavior of a Device Under Test (DUT), subject to an ISSU event.</abstract>
