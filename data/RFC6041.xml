    <abstract>
      <t>The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol defines a standard framework and mechanism for the interconnection between control elements and forwarding elements in IP routers and similar devices.  In this document we describe the applicability of the ForCES model and protocol.  We provide example deployment scenarios and functionality, as well as document applications that would be inappropriate for ForCES.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
