    <abstract>This document defines an extension to X.509 certificates. The extension defined in this document holds data about how the certificate subject was authenticated by the Certification Authority that issued the certificate in which this extension appears. This document also defines one data structure for inclusion in this extension. The data structure is designed to hold information when the subject is authenticated using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertion.</abstract>
