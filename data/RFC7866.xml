    <abstract>This document specifies the use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for delivering real-time media and metadata from a Communication Session (CS) to a recording device.  The Session Recording Protocol specifies the use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to establish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording Server (SRS) at the recording device.  This document considers only active recording, where the SRC purposefully streams media to an SRS and all participating user agents (UAs) are notified of the recording.  Passive recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the network (e.g., using port-mirroring techniques), is outside the scope of this document.  In addition, lawful intercept is outside the scope of this document.</abstract>
