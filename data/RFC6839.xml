    <abstract>A content media type name sometimes includes partitioned meta- information distinguished by a structured syntax to permit noting an attribute of the media as a suffix to the name.  This document defines several structured syntax suffixes for use with media type registrations.  In particular, it defines and registers the "+json", "+ber", "+der", "+fastinfoset", "+wbxml" and "+zip" structured syntax suffixes, and provides a media type structured syntax suffix registration form for the "+xml" structured syntax suffix.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
