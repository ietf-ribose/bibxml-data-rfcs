      <t>This memo takes a look back at the helminthiasis (infestation with, or disease caused by parasitic worms) of the Internet that was unleashed the evening of 2 November 1988.  This RFC provides information about an event that occurred in the life of the Internet.  This memo does not specify any standard.  This document provides a glimpse at the infection, its festering, and cure.  The impact of the worm on the Internet community, ethics statements, the role of the news media, crime in the computer world, and future prevention is discussed.  A documentation review presents four publications that describe in detail this particular parasitic computer program.  Reference and bibliography sections are also included.</t>
