    <abstract>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) does not allow secure peer authentication when using short credential strings, i.e., passwords.  Several proposals have been made to integrate password-authentication protocols into IKE.  This document provides an adaptation of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) to the setting of IKEv2 and demonstrates the advantages of this integration.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</abstract>
