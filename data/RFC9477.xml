    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to specify a Complaint Feedback Loop (CFBL) address as a message header field. It also defines the rules for processing and forwarding such a complaint. The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a standardized and automated way to provide Mailbox Providers with an address for a CFBL. Currently, providing and maintaining such an address is a manual and time-consuming process for Message Originators and Mailbox Providers.</t>
      <t>The mechanism specified in this document is being published as an experiment to gather feedback and gauge the interest of implementers and deployers. This document is produced through the Independent RFC Stream and was not subject to the IETF's approval process.</t>
