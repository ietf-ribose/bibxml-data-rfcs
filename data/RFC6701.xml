    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF has developed and documented policies that govern the behavior of all IETF participants with respect to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) about which they might reasonably be aware.</t>
      <t>The IETF takes conformance to these IPR policies very seriously. However, there has been some ambiguity as to what the appropriate sanctions are for the violation of these policies, and how and by whom those sanctions are to be applied.</t>
      <t>This document discusses these issues and provides a suite of potential actions that can be taken within the IETF community in cases related to patents. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
