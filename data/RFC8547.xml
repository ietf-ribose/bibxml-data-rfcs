    <abstract>
      <t>Despite growing adoption of TLS, a significant fraction of TCP traffic on the Internet remains unencrypted.  The persistence of unencrypted traffic can be attributed to at least two factors.  First, some legacy protocols lack a signaling mechanism (such as a STARTTLS command) by which to convey support for encryption, thus making incremental deployment impossible.  Second, legacy applications themselves cannot always be upgraded and therefore require a way to implement encryption transparently entirely within the transport layer.  The TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO) addresses both of these problems through a new TCP option kind providing out-of-band, fully backward-compatible negotiation of encryption.</t>
