    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method, EAP-pwd, which uses a shared password for authentication.  The password may be a low-entropy one and may be drawn from some set of possible passwords, like a dictionary, which is available to an attacker.  The underlying key exchange is resistant to active attack, passive attack, and dictionary attack.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
