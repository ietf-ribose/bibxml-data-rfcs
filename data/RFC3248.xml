    <abstract>
      <t>For historical interest, this document captures the EF Design Team's proposed solution, preferred by the original authors of RFC 2598 but not adopted by the working group in December 2000.  The original definition of EF was based on comparison of forwarding on an unloaded network.  This experimental Delay Bound (DB) PHB requires a bound on the delay of packets due to other traffic in the network.  At the Pittsburgh IETF meeting in August 2000, the Differentiated Services working group faced serious questions regarding RFC 2598 - the group's standards track definition of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB).  An 'EF Design Team' volunteered to develop a re-expression of RFC 2598, bearing in mind the issues raised in the DiffServ group.  At the San Diego IETF meeting in December 2000 the DiffServ working group decided to pursue an alternative re-expression of the EF PHB.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
