    <abstract>Several questions have been raised about the requirements and administrative procedure for registering MIME content-type and subtypes, and the use of these Media Types for other applications.  This document addresses these issues and specifies a procedure for the registration of new Media Types (content-type/subtypes).  It also generalizes the scope of use of these Media Types to make it appropriate to use the same registrations and specifications with other applications.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</abstract>
