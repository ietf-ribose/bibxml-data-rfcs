    <abstract>This memo defines the second version of the Management Information Base (MIB-II) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP- based internets.  In particular, together with its companion memos which describe the structure of management information (RFC 1155) along with the network management protocol (RFC 1157) for TCP/IP- based internets, these documents provide a simple, workable architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets and in particular the Internet community.  This document on MIB-II incorporates all of the technical content of RFC 1156 on MIB-I and extends it, without loss of compatibilty. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
