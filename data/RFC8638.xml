    <abstract>During the transition to IPv6, there are scenarios where a backbone network internally running one IP address family (referred to as the internal IP or I-IP family) connects client networks running another IP address family (referred to as the external IP or E-IP family). In such cases, the I-IP backbone needs to offer both unicast and multicast transit services to the client E-IP networks. This document describes a mechanism for supporting multicast across backbone networks where the I-IP and E-IP protocol families differ. The document focuses on the IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, due to lack of real-world use cases for the IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario.</abstract>
