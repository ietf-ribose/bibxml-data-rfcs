    <abstract>There is a need for common definitions of terminology in the work to be done around IP mobility.  This document defines terms for mobility related terminology.  The document originated out of work done in the Seamoby Working Group but has broader applicability for terminology used in IETF-wide discourse on technology for mobility and IP networks.  Other working groups dealing with mobility may want to take advantage of this terminology.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
