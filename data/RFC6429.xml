    <abstract>This document clarifies the Zero Window Probes (ZWPs) described in RFC 1122 ("Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers").  In particular, it clarifies the actions that can be taken on connections that are experiencing the ZWP condition.  Rather than making a change to the standard, this document clarifies what has been until now a misinterpretation of the standard as specified in RFC 1122.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
