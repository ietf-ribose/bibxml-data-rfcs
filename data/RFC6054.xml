    <abstract>Counter modes have been defined for block ciphers such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  Counter modes use a counter, which is typically assumed to be incremented by a single sender.  This memo describes the use of counter modes when applied to the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH) in multiple-sender group applications.
