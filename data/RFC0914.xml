    <abstract>
      <t>This RFC focuses discussion on the particular problems in the ARPA-Internet of low speed network interconnection with personal computers, and possible methods of solution.  None of the proposed solutions in this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution to the problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards.</t>
