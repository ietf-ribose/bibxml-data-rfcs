    <abstract>A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) have been proposed.  Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward standardization.  It is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in the future.  This document defines a mechanism for advertising LDP enhancements at session initialization time, as well as a mechanism to enable and disable enhancements after LDP session establishment.
