    <abstract>IPv6 supports datagrams larger than 65535 bytes long, often referred to as jumbograms, through use of the Jumbo Payload hop-by-hop option.  The UDP protocol has a 16-bit length field that keeps it from being able to make use of jumbograms, and though TCP does not have a length field, both the MSS option and the Urgent field are constrained by 16-bits.  This document describes some simple changes that can be made to allow TCP and UDP to make use of IPv6 jumbograms. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
