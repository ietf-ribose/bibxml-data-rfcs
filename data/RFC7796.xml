    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a generic Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution, which uses VLANs to indicate root or leaf traffic to support Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) services.  A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model is illustrated as an example for the solution.  In the solution, E-Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by Pseudowires (PWs), which carry the VLAN indicating the E-Tree attribute.  The MAC address-based Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as specified in RFC 4762 and RFC 4448, respectively.  A signaling mechanism is described to support E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping negotiation.</t>
