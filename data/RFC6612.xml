    <abstract>The use of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) in the same network requires some care.  This document discusses scenarios where such mixed usage is appropriate and points out the need for interaction between the two mechanisms.  Solutions and recommendations to enable these scenarios are also described.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
