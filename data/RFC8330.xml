    <abstract>A network may contain links with variable discrete bandwidth, e.g., microwave and copper.  The bandwidth of such links may change discretely in response to a changing external environment.  The word "availability" is typically used to describe such links during network planning.  This document defines a new type of Generalized Switching Capability-Specific Information (SCSI) TLV to extend the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol.  The extension can be used for route computation in a network that contains links with variable discrete bandwidth.  Note that this document only covers the mechanisms by which the availability information is distributed.  The mechanisms by which availability information of a link is determined and the use of the distributed information for route computation are outside the scope of this document.  It is intended that technology-specific documents will reference this document to describe specific uses.</abstract>
