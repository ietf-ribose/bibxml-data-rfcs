      <t>This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) to support multicasting.  IP multicasting is the transmission of an IP datagram to a "host group", a set hosts identified by a single IP destination address.  A multicast datagram is delivered to all members of its destination host group with the same "best-efforts" reliability as regular unicast IP datagrams.  It is proposed as a standard for IP multicasting in the Internet.  This specification is a major revision of RFC-988.</t>
