      <t>NNTP specifies a protocol for the distribution, inquiry, retrieval, and posting of news articles using a reliable stream-based transmission of news among the ARPA-Internet community.  NNTP is designed so that news articles are stored in a central database allowing a subscriber to select only those items he wishes to read.  Indexing, cross-referencing, and expiration of aged messages are also provided.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>
