      <t>This document discusses current mobility extensions to IP-layer multicast.  It describes problems arising from mobile group communication in general, the case of multicast listener mobility, and problems for mobile senders using Any Source Multicast and Source-Specific Multicast.  Characteristic aspects of multicast routing and deployment issues for fixed IPv6 networks are summarized.  Specific properties and interplays with the underlying network access are surveyed with respect to the relevant technologies in the wireless domain.  It outlines the principal approaches to multicast mobility, together with a comprehensive exploration of the mobile multicast problem and solution space.  This document concludes with a conceptual road map for initial steps in standardization for use by future mobile multicast protocol designers.  This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
