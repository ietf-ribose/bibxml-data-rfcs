    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a method to inform Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) clients when RTP packets are transmitted at a time other than their 'nominal' transmission time.  It also provides a mechanism to provide improved inter-arrival jitter reports from the clients, that take into account the reported transmission times. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
