    <abstract>IEEE Std 802.16 is an air interface specification for fixed and mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems.  Service-specific convergence sublayers to which upper-layer protocols interface are a part of the IEEE 802.16 MAC (Medium Access Control).  The Packet convergence sublayer (CS) is used for the transport of all packet- based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP) and IEEE 802.3 LAN/MAN CSMA/CD Access Method (Ethernet).  IPv6 packets can be sent and received via the IP-specific part of the Packet CS.  This document specifies the addressing and operation of IPv6 over the IP-specific part of the Packet CS for hosts served by a network that utilizes the IEEE Std 802.16 air interface.  It recommends the assignment of a unique prefix (or prefixes) to each host and allows the host to use multiple identifiers within that prefix, including support for randomly generated interface identifiers.
