    <abstract>
      <t>The U.S.  National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) solicited a request from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to propose how the NTIA should end its oversight of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions.  After broad consultations, ICANN in turn created the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group.  That group solicited proposals for the three major IANA functions: names, numbers, and protocol parameters.  This document contains the IETF response to that solicitation for protocol parameters.  It was included in an aggregate response to the NTIA alongside those for names and numbering resources that are being developed by their respective operational communities.  A reference to that response may be found in the introduction, and additional correspondence is included in the Appendix.</t>
