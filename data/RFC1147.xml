    <abstract>The goal of this FYI memo is to provide practical information to site administrators and network managers.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify any standard.  It is not a statement of IAB policy or recommendations. [Also FYI 2.] This catalog contains descriptions of several tools available to assist network managers in debugging and maintaining TCP/IP internets and interconnected communications resources.  Entries in the catalog tell what a tool does, how it works, and how it can be obtained.</abstract>
