    <abstract>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real- time Transport Protocol (RTP) in order to provide a variety of short- term and long-term reception statistics.  The available reporting may include aggregate information across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting.  This document specifies a per-packet report metric capturing individual packets discarded from the de- jitter buffer after successful reception.</abstract>
