    <abstract>
      <t>The Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) AS1, AS2, and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents. Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message. As adoption of EDIINT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport. Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and stored in a single message. This Informational RFC describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDIINT transport message. The attachments are stored within the MIME multipart/related structure. A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
