    <abstract>
      <t>This RFC provides the initial version of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets in the short-term. In particular, together with its companion memos which describe the structure of management information along with the initial network management protocol, these documents provide a simple, workable architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets, and in particular, the Internet. This memo specifies a draft standard for the Internet community. TCP/IP implementations in the Internet which are network manageable are expected to adopt and implement this specification.</t>
