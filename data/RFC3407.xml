    <abstract>This document defines a set of Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes that enables SDP to provide a minimal and backwards compatible capability declaration mechanism.  Such capability declarations can be used as input to a subsequent session negotiation, which is done by means outside the scope of this document.  This provides a simple and limited solution to the general capability negotiation problem being addressed by the next generation of SDP, also known as SDPng. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
