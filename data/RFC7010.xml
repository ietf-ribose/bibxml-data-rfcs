    <abstract>This document briefly introduces the existing mechanisms that could be utilized for IPv6 site renumbering and tries to cover most of the explicit issues and requirements associated with IPv6 renumbering.  The content is mainly a gap analysis that provides a basis for future works to identify and develop solutions or to stimulate such development as appropriate.  The gap analysis is organized by the main steps of a renumbering process.</abstract>
