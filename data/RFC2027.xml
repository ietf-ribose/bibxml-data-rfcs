    <abstract>The process by which the members of the IAB and IESG are selected, confirmed, and recalled has been exercised four times since its formal creation.  The evolution of the process has relied principally on oral tradition as a means by which the lessons learned could be passed on to successive committees.  This document is a self-consistent, organized compilation of the process as it is known today.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</abstract>
