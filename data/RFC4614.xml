    <abstract>This document contains a "roadmap" to the Requests for Comments (RFC) documents relating to the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  This roadmap provides a brief summary of the documents defining TCP and various TCP extensions that have accumulated in the RFC series.  This serves as a guide and quick reference for both TCP implementers and other parties who desire information contained in the TCP-related RFCs.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
