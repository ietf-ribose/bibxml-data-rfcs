    <abstract>A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have never been formally deprecated.  This document deprecates such IPv4 options, thus cleaning up the corresponding IANA registry.  Additionally, it obsoletes RFCs 1385, 1393, 1475, and 1770, and requests that the RFC Editor change their status to Historic. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
