    <abstract>This RFC suggests a method to allow the existing IP addressing, including the IP protocol field, to be used for the ISO Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP).  This is a draft solution to one of the problems inherent in the use of "ISO-grams" in the DOD Internet.  Related issues will be discussed in subsequent RFCs.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</abstract>
