    <abstract>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the High Quality (HQ) profile of Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers Standard ST 2042-1, known as VC-2. This document describes the transport of HQ Profile VC-2 in RTP packets and has applications for low-complexity, high-bandwidth streaming of both lossless and lossy compressed video. The HQ profile of VC-2 is intended for low-latency video compression (with latency potentially on the order of lines of video) at high data rates (with compression ratios on the order of 2:1 or 4:1).</abstract>
