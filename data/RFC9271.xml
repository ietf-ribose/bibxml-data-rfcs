      <t>This document describes the command/response protocol currently used in the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and other power devices often deployed in small offices and in IT installations subject to an erratic public power supply.  The UPS units typically interface to an Attachment Daemon in the system they protect.  This daemon is in turn polled by a Management Daemon that notifies users and system administrators of power supply incidents and automates system shutdown decisions.  The commands and responses described by this document are exchanged between the UPS Attachment Daemon and the Management Daemon.  The practice current when this protocol was first developed risks weak security, and this is addressed in the Security Considerations sections of this document.</t>
