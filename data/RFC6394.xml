      <t>Many current applications use the certificate-based authentication features in Transport Layer Security (TLS) to allow clients to verify that a connected server properly represents a desired domain name.  Typically, this authentication has been based on PKIX certificate chains rooted in well-known certificate authorities (CAs), but additional information can be provided via the DNS itself.  This document describes a set of use cases in which the DNS and DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) could be used to make assertions that support the TLS authentication process.  The main focus of this document is TLS server authentication, but it also covers TLS client authentication for applications where TLS clients are identified by domain names. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
