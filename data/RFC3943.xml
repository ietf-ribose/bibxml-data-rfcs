    <abstract>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol (RFC 2246) includes features to negotiate selection of a lossless data compression method as part of the TLS Handshake Protocol and then to apply the algorithm associated with the selected method as part of the TLS Record Protocol.  TLS defines one standard compression method, which specifies that data exchanged via the record protocol will not be compressed.  This document describes an additional compression method associated with the Lempel-Ziv-Stac (LZS) lossless data compression algorithm for use with TLS.  This document also defines the application of the LZS algorithm to the TLS Record Protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
