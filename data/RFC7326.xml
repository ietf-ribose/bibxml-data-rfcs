    <abstract>This document defines a framework for Energy Management (EMAN) for devices and device components within, or connected to, communication networks.  The framework presents a physical reference model and information model.  The information model consists of an Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects.  Each Energy Object can be attributed with identity, classification, and context.  Energy Objects can be monitored and controlled with respect to power, Power State, energy, demand, Power Attributes, and battery.  Additionally, the framework models relationships and capabilities between Energy Objects.</abstract>
