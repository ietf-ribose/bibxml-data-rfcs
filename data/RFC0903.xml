    <abstract>This RFC suggests a method for workstations to dynamically find their protocol address (e.g., their Internet Address), when they know only their hardware address (e.g., their attached physical network address).  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</abstract>
