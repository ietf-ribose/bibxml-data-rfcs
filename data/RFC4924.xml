    <abstract>This document provides a review of previous IAB statements on Internet transparency, as well a discussion of new transparency issues.  Far from having lessened in relevance, technical implications of intentionally or inadvertently impeding network transparency play a critical role in the Internet's ability to support innovation and global communication.  This document provides some specific illustrations of those potential impacts.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
