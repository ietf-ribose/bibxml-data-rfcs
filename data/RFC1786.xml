    <abstract>This document is an update to the original `ripe-81' proposal for representing and storing routing polices within the RIPE database.  It incorporates several extensions proposed by Merit Inc.  and gives details of a generalized IP routing policy representation to be used by all Internet routing registries.  It acts as both tutorial and provides details of database objects and attributes that use and make up a routing registry.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</abstract>
