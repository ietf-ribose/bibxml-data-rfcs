    <abstract>This memo is a policy statement on the implementation of the Domain Style Naming System in the Internet.  This memo is a partial update of RFC 881.  The intent of this memo is to detail the schedule for the implementation for the Domain Style Naming System.  The names of hosts will be changed to domain style names.  Hosts will begin to use domain style names on 14-Mar-84, and the use of old style names will be completely phased out before 2-May-84.  This applies to both the ARPA research hosts and the DDN operational hosts.  This is an official policy statement of the ICCB and the DARPA.</abstract>
