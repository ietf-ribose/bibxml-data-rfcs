    <abstract>Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) is a routing technique for routing packets along multiple paths of equal cost.  The forwarding engine identifies paths by next-hop.  When forwarding a packet the router must decide which next-hop (path) to use.  This document gives an analysis of one method for making that decision.  The analysis includes the performance of the algorithm and the disruption caused by changes to the set of next-hops.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
