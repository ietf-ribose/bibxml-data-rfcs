    <abstract>
      <t>CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application-layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of information asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim value.  CWT is derived from JSON Web Token (JWT) but uses CBOR rather than JSON.</t>
