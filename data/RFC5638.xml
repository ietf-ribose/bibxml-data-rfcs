    <abstract>For Internet-centric usage, the number of SIP-required standards for presence and IM and audio/video communications can be drastically smaller than what has been published by using only the rendezvous and session-initiation capabilities of SIP. The simplification is achieved by avoiding the emulation of telephony and its model of the intelligent network. 'Simple SIP' relies on powerful computing endpoints. Simple SIP desktop applications can be combined with rich Internet applications (RIAs). Significant telephony features may also be implemented in the endpoints. This approach for SIP reduces the number of SIP standards with which to comply -- from roughly 100 currently, and still growing, to about 11. References for NAT traversal and for security are also provided. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
