    <abstract>
      <t>This RFC proposes two extensions to the Domain Name System: - A specific method for entering and retrieving RRs which map between network names and numbers. - Ideas for a general method for describing mappings between arbitrary identifiers and numbers.  The method for mapping between network names and addresses is a proposed standard, the ideas for a general method are experimental.</t>
