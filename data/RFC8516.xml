    <abstract>A Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) server can experience temporary overload because one or more clients are sending requests to the server at a higher rate than the server is capable or willing to handle.  This document defines a new CoAP response code for a server to indicate that a client should reduce the rate of requests.</abstract>
