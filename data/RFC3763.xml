    <abstract>With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes, it becomes increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance metrics with high precision.  To do so in an interoperable manner, a common protocol for such measurements is required.  This document specifies requirements for a one-way active measurement protocol (OWAMP) standard.  The protocol can measure one-way delay, as well as other unidirectional characteristics, such as one-way loss.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
