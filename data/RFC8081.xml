    <abstract>This memo serves to register and document the "font" top-level media type, under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered.  This document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes, which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered under the "application" tree by their separate registrations.</abstract>
