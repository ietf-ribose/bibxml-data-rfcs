    <abstract>
      <t>Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) based on Frame Relay or ATM circuits have been around a long time; more recently, Ethernet VPNs, including Virtual Private LAN Service, have become popular.  Traditional L2VPNs often required a separate Service Provider infrastructure for each type and yet another for the Internet and IP VPNs.  In addition, L2VPN provisioning was cumbersome.  This document presents a new approach to the problem of offering L2VPN services where the L2VPN customer's experience is virtually identical to that offered by traditional L2VPNs, but such that a Service Provider can maintain a single network for L2VPNs, IP VPNs, and the Internet, as well as a common provisioning methodology for all services.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
