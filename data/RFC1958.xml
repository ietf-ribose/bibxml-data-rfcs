      <t>The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan.  While this process of evolution is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture.  This is intended for general guidance and general interest, and is in no way intended to be a formal or invariant reference model.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</t>
