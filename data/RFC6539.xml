    <abstract>Cryptographic protocols based on public-key methods have been traditionally based on certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to support certificate management.  The emerging field of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) protocols allows simplification of infrastructure requirements via a Private-Key Generator (PKG) while providing the same flexibility.  However, one significant limitation of IBE methods is that the PKG can end up being a de facto key escrow server, with undesirable consequences.  Another observed deficiency is a lack of mutual authentication of communicating parties.  This document specifies the Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) protocol.  IBAKE does not suffer from the key escrow problem and in addition provides mutual authentication as well as perfect forward and backward secrecy.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
