      <t>This document explores the issues in the registration of internationalized domain names (IDNs).  The basic IDN definition allows a very large number of possible characters in domain names, and this richness may lead to serious user confusion about similar-looking names.  To avoid this confusion, the IDN registration process must impose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations.  This document suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to define and implement such rules for a broad range of languages, including adaptation of methods developed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean domain names.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
