    <abstract>
      <t>The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) scheme "CRID:" has been devised to allow references to current or future scheduled publications of broadcast media content over television distribution platforms and the Internet.</t>
      <t>The initial intended application is as an embedded link within scheduled programme description metadata that can be used by the home user or agent to associate a programme selection with the corresponding programme location information for subsequent automatic acquisition.</t>
      <t>This document reproduces the \%TV-Anytime CRID definition found in the \%TV-Anytime content referencing specification, and is published as an RFC for ease of access and registration with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
