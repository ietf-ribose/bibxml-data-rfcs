    <abstract>This memo is intended to explore how Type-of-Service might be implemented in the Internet.  The proposal describes a method of queuing which can provide the different classes of service.  The technique also prohibits one class of service from consuming excessive resources or excluding other classes of service.  This is an "idea paper" and discussion is strongly encouraged.</abstract>
