    <abstract>This memo provides guidance to TCP implementers that is intended to help improve connection convergence to steady-state operation without affecting interoperability.  It updates and replaces RFC 2140's description of sharing TCP state, as typically represented in TCP Control Blocks, among similar concurrent or consecutive connections.</abstract>
