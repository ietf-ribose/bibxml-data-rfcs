    <abstract>Many IETF protocols use cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication, or digital signature.  Communicating peers must support a common set of cryptographic algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly.  This memo provides guidelines to ensure that protocols have the ability to migrate from one mandatory-to-implement algorithm suite to another over time.</abstract>
