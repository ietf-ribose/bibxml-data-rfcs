    <abstract>This document describes a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format for transporting Enhanced AC-3 (E-AC-3) encoded audio data.  E-AC-3 is a high-quality, multichannel audio coding format and is an extension of the AC-3 audio coding format, which is used in US High-Definition Television (HDTV), DVD, cable and satellite television, and other media.  E-AC-3 is an optional audio format in US and world wide digital television and high-definition DVD formats.  The RTP payload format as presented in this document includes support for data fragmentation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
