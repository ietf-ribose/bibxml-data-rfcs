    <abstract>This memo provides an update and clarification to RFC 1816.  This document describes the registration policies for the top-level domain ".GOV".  The purpose of the domain is to provide naming conventions that identify US Federal government agencies in order to facilitate access to their electronic resources.  This memo provides guidance for registrations by Federal Agencies that avoids name duplication and facilitates responsiveness to the public.  It restricts registrations to coincide with the approved structure of the US government and the advice of its Chief Information Officers.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</abstract>
