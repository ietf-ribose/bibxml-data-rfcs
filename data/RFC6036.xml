    <abstract>This document describes practices and plans that are emerging among Internet Service Providers for the deployment of IPv6 services.  They are based on practical experience so far, as well as current plans and requirements, reported in a survey of a number of ISPs carried out in early 2010.  This document identifies a number of technology gaps, but it does not make recommendations.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
