    <abstract>The motivation for the development of the tunnel broker model is to help early IPv6 adopters to hook up to an existing IPv6 network (e.g., the 6bone) and to get stable, permanent IPv6 addresses and DNS names.  The concept of the tunnel broker was first presented at Orlando's IETF in December 1998.  Two implementations were demonstrated during the Grenoble IPng &amp; NGtrans interim meeting in February 1999.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
