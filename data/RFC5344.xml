    <abstract>This document describes several use cases of peering of non-VoIP (Voice over IP) services between two or more Service Providers.  These Service Providers create a peering relationship between themselves, thus enabling their users to collaborate with users on the other Service Provider network.  The target of this document is to drive requirements for peering between domains that provide the non-VoIP based collaboration services with presence and, in particular, Instant Messaging (IM).  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
