    <abstract>This document describes modifications to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to address problems that have been identified with the SIP non-INVITE transaction.  These modifications reduce the probability of messages losing the race condition inherent in the non-INVITE transaction and reduce useless network traffic.  They also improve the robustness of SIP networks when elements stop responding.  These changes update behavior defined in RFC 3261. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
