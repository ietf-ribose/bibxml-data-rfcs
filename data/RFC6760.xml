    <abstract>One of the goals of the authors of Multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) was to retire AppleTalk and the AppleTalk Name Binding Protocol (NBP) and to replace them with an IP-based solution.  This document presents a brief overview of the capabilities of AppleTalk NBP and outlines the properties required of an IP-based replacement.</abstract>
