      <t>This RFC suggests a change in the method of specifying the IP address to add new classes of networks to be called F, G, H, and K, to reduce the amount of wasted address space, and to increase the available IP address number space, especially for smaller organizations or classes of connectors that do not need or do not want a full Class C IP address.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.</t>
