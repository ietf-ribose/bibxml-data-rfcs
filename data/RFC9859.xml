    <abstract>
      <t>This document generalizes and extends the use of DNS NOTIFY (RFC 1996) beyond conventional zone transfer hints to allow other types of actions that were previously lacking a trigger mechanism to be triggered via the DNS. Notifications merely nudge the receiver to initiate a predefined action promptly (instead of on a schedule); they do not alter the action itself (including any security checks it might employ).</t>
      <t>To enable this functionality, a method for discovering the receiver endpoint for such notification messages is introduced, via the new DSYNC record type. Notification types are recorded in a new registry, with initial support for parental NS and DS record updates including DNSSEC bootstrapping.</t>
