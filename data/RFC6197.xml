    <abstract>Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) maps service identifiers and location information to service contact URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover available services for a particular location, it will perform a <listservicesbylocation> query to the LoST server.  However, the LoST server, in its response, does not provide context information; that is, it does not provide any additional information about the geographical region within which the returned list of services is considered valid.  Therefore, this document defines a Service List Boundary that returns a local context along with the list of services returned, in order to assist the client in not missing a change in available services when moving.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</listservicesbylocation></abstract>
