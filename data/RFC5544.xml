    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an envelope that can be used to bind a file (not necessarily protected by means of cryptographic techniques) with one or more time-stamp tokens obtained for that file, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning defined in RFC 3161 or its successors. Additional types of temporal evidence are also allowed.</t>
      <t>The proposed envelope is based on the Cryptographic Message Syntax as defined in RFC 5652. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
