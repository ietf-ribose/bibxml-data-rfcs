      <t>The "Barriers to Internet Access of Services (BIAS)" workshop was
convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from January 15-17,
2024 as a three-day online meeting. Based on the submitted position
papers, the workshop covered three areas of interest: the role of
Community Networks in Internet access of services, reports and
comments on the observed digital divide, and measurements of
censorship and censorship circumvention. This report summarizes the
workshop's discussions and serves as a reference for reports on the
current barriers to Internet access.</t>
