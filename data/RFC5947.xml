    <abstract>This document states requirements for a standardized SIP registration mechanism for multiple addresses of record (AORs), the mechanism being suitable for deployment by SIP service providers on a large scale in support of small to medium sized Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs).  The requirements are for a solution that can, as a minimum, support AORs based on E.164 numbers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
