    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data structure.  A SET describes statements of fact from the perspective of an issuer about a subject.  These statements of fact represent an event that occurred directly to or about a security subject, for example, a statement about the issuance or revocation of a token on behalf of a subject.  This specification is intended to enable representing security- and identity-related events.  A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted.  SETs can be distributed via protocols such as HTTP.</t>
