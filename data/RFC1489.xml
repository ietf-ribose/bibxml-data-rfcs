      <t>Though the proposed character set "koi8-r" is not currently an international standard, there is very large user community (including Relcom Net) supporting it.  Factually, "koi8-r" is de-facto standard for Unix and global network applications in the former Soviet Union.  This is the reason the Society of Unix User Groups (SUUG) believes "koi8-r" should be registered.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.</t>
