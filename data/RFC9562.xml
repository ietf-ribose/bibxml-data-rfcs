    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifiers) --
also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifiers) -- and a Uniform
Resource Name namespace for UUIDs. A UUID is 128 bits long and is
intended to guarantee uniqueness across space and time. UUIDs were
originally used in the Apollo Network Computing System (NCS), later
in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF's) Distributed Computing
Environment (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows platforms.</t>
      <t>This specification is derived from the OSF DCE specification with the
kind permission of the OSF (now known as "The Open Group"). Information from earlier versions of the OSF DCE specification have
been incorporated into this document. This document obsoletes RFC
4122.</t>
