    <abstract>
      <t>Notification and filtering mechanisms can make email more enjoyable on mobile and other constrained devices (such as those with limited screen sizes, memory, data transfer rates, etc.). Notifications make the client aware of significant events (such as the arrival of new mail) so it can react (such as by fetching interesting mail immediately). Filtering reduces the visible mail to a set of messages that meet some criteria for "interesting". This functionality is included in the goals of the Lemonade (Enhancements to Internet email to Support Diverse Service Environments) Working Group.</t>
      <t>This document also discusses the use of server-to-server notifications, and how server to server notifications fit into an architecture that provides server to client notifications. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
