    <abstract>This document describes how to use information associated with a trust anchor public key when validating certification paths.  This information can be used to constrain the usage of a trust anchor.  Typically, constraints are used to limit the certificate policies and names that can appear in certification paths validated using a trust anchor.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
