    <abstract>The content of many communication services depends on the context, such as the user's location.  We describe a 'service' URN that allows well-known context-dependent services that can be resolved in a distributed manner to be identified.  Examples include emergency services, directory assistance, and call-before-you-dig hot lines. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
