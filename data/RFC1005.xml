    <abstract>This RFC is a proposed specification for the encoding of Class A IP addresses for use on ARPANET-style networks such as the Milnet and Arpanet, and for enhancements to the ARPANET AHIP Host Access Protocol (AHIP; formerly known as 1822).  These enhancements increase the size of the PSN field, allow ARPANET hosts to use logical names to address each other, allow for the communication of type-of-service information from the host to the PSN and enable the PSN to provide congestion feedback to the host on a connection basis.</abstract>
