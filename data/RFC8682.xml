      <t>This document describes the TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), which produces 32-bit pseudorandom unsigned integers and aims at having a simple-to-use and deterministic solution.  This PRNG is a small-sized variant of the Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG.  The main advantage of TinyMT32 over MT is the use of a small internal state, compatible with most target platforms that include embedded devices, while keeping reasonably good randomness that represents a significant improvement compared to the Park-Miller Linear Congruential PRNG.  However, neither the TinyMT nor MT PRNG is meant to be used for cryptographic applications.</t>
