    <abstract>This document defines the NSA (No Secrecy Afforded) certificate extension appropriate for use in certain PKIX (X.509 Pubic Key Certificates) digital certificates.  Historically, clients and servers strived to maintain the privacy of their keys; however, the secrecy of their private keys cannot always be maintained.  In certain circumstances, a client or a server might feel that they will be compelled in the future to share their keys with a third party.  Some clients and servers also have been compelled to share their keys and wish to indicate to relying parties upon certificate renewal that their keys have in fact been shared with a third party.</abstract>
