Participants frequently need to search and browse the archives of these lists and have asked for improved search capabilities.  The current archive mechanism could also be made more efficient.  This memo captures the requirements for improved email list archiving and searching systems.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
