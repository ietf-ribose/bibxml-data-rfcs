      <t>This document extends the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol document [IKEv2].  With some IPsec peers, particularly in the remote access scenario, it is desirable to repeat the mutual authentication periodically.  The purpose of this is to limit the time that security associations (SAs) can be used by a third party who has gained control of the IPsec peer.  This document describes a mechanism to perform this function.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>
