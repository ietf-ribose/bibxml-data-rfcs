    <abstract>
      <t>The procedures for handling SIP re-INVITEs are described in RFC 3261.  Implementation and deployment experience has uncovered a number of issues with the original documentation, and this document provides additional procedures that update the original specification to address those issues.  In particular, this document defines in which situations a UAS (User Agent Server) should generate a success response and in which situations a UAS should generate an error response to a re-INVITE.  Additionally, this document defines further details of procedures related to target-refresh requests. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
