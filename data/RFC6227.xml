    <abstract>It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing architecture is facing challenges in scalability, mobility, multi-homing, and inter-domain traffic engineering.  The Routing Research Group is investigating an alternate architecture to meet these challenges.  This document consists of a prioritized list of design goals for the target architecture.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
