    <abstract>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as either "Active" or "Passive".  Some methods may use a subset of both Active and Passive attributes, and we refer to these as "Hybrid Methods".  This memo also describes multiple dimensions to help evaluate new methods as they emerge.</abstract>
