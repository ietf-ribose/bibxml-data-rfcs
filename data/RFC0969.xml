    <abstract>
      <t>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is a preliminary discussion of the Network Block Transfer (NETBLT) protocol.  NETBLT is intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.  It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is structured to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.  This description is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation of this document is not advised.  See RFC-998.</t>
