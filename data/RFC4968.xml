    <abstract>This document provides different IPv6 link models that are suitable for IEEE 802.16 based networks and provides analysis of various considerations for each link model and the applicability of each link model under different deployment scenarios.  This document is the result of a design team (DT) that was formed to analyze the IPv6 link models for IEEE 802.16 based networks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
