    <abstract>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.  This document specifies two different ways for validating resolvers to signal to a server which keys are referenced in their chain of trust.  The data from such signaling allow zone administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers in a DNSSEC-signed zone.</abstract>
