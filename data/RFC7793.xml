    <abstract>RFC 6598 specifies that "Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space addresses [100.64.0.0/10] MUST NOT be forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure." This document formally directs IANA to add the associated zones to the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry" to prevent such queries from accidentally leaking to the global DNS infrastructure.</abstract>
