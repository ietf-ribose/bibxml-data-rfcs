      <t>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format for RFCs to XML as the canonical format with more human-readable formats rendered from that XML.  The high-level requirements that informed this change were defined in RFC 6949, "RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development".  Plain text remains an important format for many in the IETF community, and it will be one of the publication formats rendered from the XML.  This document outlines the rendering requirements for the plain-text RFC publication format.  These requirements do not apply to plain-text RFCs published before the format transition.</t>
