The ISE is overall responsible for activities within the Independent Submission stream, working with draft editors and reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production Center and Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor (RSE).  The ISE is appointed by the IAB, and also interacts with the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC).
