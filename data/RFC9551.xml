    <abstract>
      <t>Deterministic Networking (DetNet), as defined in RFC 8655, aims to provide bounded end-to-end latency on top of the network infrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments. This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific requirements of the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) recommended to maintain a deterministic network. The document will be used in future work that defines the applicability of and extension of OAM protocols for a deterministic network. With the implementation of the OAM framework in DetNet, an operator will have a real-time view of the network infrastructure regarding the network's ability to respect the Service Level Objective (SLO), such as packet delay, delay variation, and packet-loss ratio, assigned to each DetNet flow.</t>
