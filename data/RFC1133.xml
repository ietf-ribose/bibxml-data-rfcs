    <abstract>This document is a case study of the implementation of routing between the NSFNET and the DDN components (the MILNET and the ARPANET).  We hope that it can be used to expand towards interconnection of other Administrative Domains.  We would welcome discussion and suggestions about the methods employed for the interconnections.  No standards are specified in this memo.</abstract>
