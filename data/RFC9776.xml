    <abstract>
      <t>The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is the protocol used by IPv4 systems to report their IP multicast group memberships to neighboring multicast routers. Version 3 of IGMP (IGMPv3) adds support for source filtering, that is, the ability for a system to report interest in receiving packets only from specific source addresses, or from all but specific source addresses, sent to a particular multicast address. That information may be used by multicast routing protocols to avoid delivering multicast packets from specific sources to networks where there are no interested receivers.</t>
      <t>This document specifies IGMPv3. It is a revised version of RFC 3376 that includes clarifications and fixes for errata, and it is backward compatible with RFC 3376.</t>
      <t>This document updates RFC 2236 and obsoletes RFC 3376.</t>
