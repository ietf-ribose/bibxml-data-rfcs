    <abstract>
      <t>Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is a means for protecting the quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This memo is one of a series describing possible boundary-node behaviors for a PCN-domain.  The behavior described here is that for a form of measurement-based load control using two PCN marking states: not- marked and excess-traffic-marked.  This behavior is known informally as the Single Marking (SM) PCN-boundary-node behavior.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>
