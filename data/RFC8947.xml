    <abstract>
      <t>In certain environments, e.g., large-scale virtualization deployments, new devices are created in an automated manner.  Such devices may have their link-layer addresses assigned in an automated fashion.  With sufficient scale, the likelihood of a collision using random assignment without duplication detection is not acceptable.  Therefore, an allocation mechanism is required.  This document proposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer address assignments where preassigned link-layer address assignments (such as by a manufacturer) are not possible or are unnecessary.</t>
