      <t>This document explores the issues involved in the use of edge computing resources to operationalize a media use case that involves an Extended Reality (XR) application. In particular, this document discusses an XR application that can run on devices having different form factors (such as different physical sizes and shapes) and needs edge computing resources to mitigate the effect of problems such as the need to support interactive communication requiring low latency, limited battery power, and heat dissipation from those devices. This document also discusses the expected behavior of XR applications, which can be used to manage traffic, and the service requirements for XR applications to be able to run on the network. Network operators who are interested in providing edge computing resources to operationalize the requirements of such applications are the intended audience for this document.</t>
