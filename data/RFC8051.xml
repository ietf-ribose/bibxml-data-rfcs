    <abstract>
      <t>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network in order to provide traffic-engineering calculations for its associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  This document describes general considerations for a stateful PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases.  PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate documents.</t>
