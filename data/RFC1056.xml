      <t>This memo is a discussion of the Pcmail workstation based distributed mail system.  It is identical to the discussion in RFC-993, save that a new, much simpler mail transport protocol is described.  The new transport protocol is the result of continued research into ease of protocol implementation and use issues.</t>
