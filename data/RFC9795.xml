    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), a token for conveying cryptographically signed call information about personal communications, to include rich metadata about a call and caller that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted, and subsequently rendered to the called party. This framework is intended to include and extend caller- and call-specific information beyond human-readable display name, comparable to the "Caller ID" function common on the telephone network. It is also enhanced with an integrity mechanism that is designed to protect the authoring and transport of this information for different authoritative use cases.</t>
