    <abstract>
      <t>The IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridges (PBBs) specification defines an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple Provider Bridged Networks (PBNs). Provider backbone bridging was defined by IEEE as a connectionless technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels. PBB can be used to attain better scalability than Provider Bridges (PBs) in terms of the number of customer Media Access Control addresses and the number of service instances that can be supported.</t>
      <t>The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) provides a framework for extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a routed MPLS backbone without running the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or the Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) across the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in service provider networks.</t>
      <t>This document discusses extensions to the VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining the service provider fit of the initial model.</t>
