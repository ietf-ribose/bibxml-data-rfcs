    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines the needs and requirements for a protocol to control distributed speech processing of audio streams.  By speech processing, this document specifically means automatic speech recognition (ASR), speaker recognition -- which includes both speaker identification (SI) and speaker verification (SV) -- and text-to-speech (TTS).  Other IETF protocols, such as SIP and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), address rendezvous and control for generalized media streams.  However, speech processing presents additional requirements that none of the extant IETF protocols address.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
