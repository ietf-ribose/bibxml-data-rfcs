    <abstract>OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions are used to advertise TE Link State Advertisements (LSAs) containing information about TE-enabled links. The only addresses belonging to a router that are advertised in TE LSAs are the local addresses corresponding to TE-enabled links, and the local address corresponding to the Router ID. In order to allow other routers in a network to compute Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) to a given router's local addresses, those addresses must also be advertised by OSPF TE. This document describes procedures that enhance OSPF TE to advertise a router's local addresses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
