    <abstract>This document captures the requirements for integrating IANA and RFC Editor state information into the Datatracker to provide the community with a unified tool to track the status of their document as it progresses from Internet-Draft (I-D) version -00 to RFC.  Extending the Datatracker to hold document data from I-D version -00 to RFC allows for increased automation between the Datatracker, IANA, and RFC Editor, thus reducing manual labor, processing errors, and potential delay.  Therefore, this document also describes the requirements to make such automation possible.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
