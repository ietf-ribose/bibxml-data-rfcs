      <t>This RFC specifies a method for assigning addresses other than 32-bit IPv4 addresses to data ports through the specification of a "long Port (LPRT)" command and "Long Passive (LPSV)" reply, each having as its argument a <long-host-port>, which allows for additional address families, variable length network addresses and variable length port numbers.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</long-host-port></t>
