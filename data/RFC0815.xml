    <abstract>This RFC describes an alternate approach of dealing with reassembly which reduces the bookkeeping problem to a minimum, and requires only one buffer for storage equal in size to the final datagram being reassembled, which can reassemble a datagram from any number of fragments arriving in any order with any possible pattern of overlap and duplication, and which is appropriate for almost any sort of operating system.</abstract>
