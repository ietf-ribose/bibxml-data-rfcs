    <abstract>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is the second draft of this proposal (superseding RFC-912) and incorporates a more formal description of the syntax for the request and response dialog, as well as a change to specify the type of user identification returned.</abstract>
