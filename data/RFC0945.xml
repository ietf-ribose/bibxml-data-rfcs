    <abstract>In May 1983 the National Research Council (NRC) was asked jointly by DoD and NBS to study the issues and recommend a course of action.  The final report of the NRC committee was published in February 1985 (see RFC-942).  The enclosed letter is from Donald C.  Latham (ASDC3I) to DCA transmitting the NRC report and requesting specific actions relative to the recommendations of the report.  This RFC reproduces a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASDC3I) to the Director of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA).  This letter is distributed for information only.</abstract>
