    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends the current error-handling procedures for mapping of verification failure reasons to 4xx codes for Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) and the Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It extends the ability to use the Reason header field as an option for conveying an error associated with an Identity header field to the upstream authentication service when local policy dictates that the call should continue in the presence of a verification failure. This document also defines procedures that enable a failure reason to be mapped to a specific Identity header field for scenarios that use multiple Identity header fields, where some may have errors and others may not. The handling of those situations is also defined.</t>
