      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes extensions to the Entity MIB to provide information about the state of physical entities.</t>
      <t>In addition, this memo defines a set of Textual Conventions to represent various states of an entity. The intent is that these Textual Conventions will be imported and used in MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
