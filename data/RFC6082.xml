    <abstract>RFC 2482, "Language Tagging in Unicode Plain Text", describes a mechanism for using special Unicode language tag characters to identify languages when needed without more general markup such as that provided by XML.  The Unicode Consortium has deprecated that facility and strongly recommends against its use.  RFC 2482 has been moved to Historic status to reduce the possibility that Internet implementers would consider that system an appropriate mechanism for identifying languages.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
