    <abstract>This document describes an optional extension to Router Advertisement messages for communicating default router preferences and more-specific routes from routers to hosts.  This improves the ability of hosts to pick an appropriate router, especially when the host is multi-homed and the routers are on different links.  The preference values and specific routes advertised to hosts require administrative configuration; they are not automatically derived from routing tables. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
