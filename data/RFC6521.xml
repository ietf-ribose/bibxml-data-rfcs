      <t>This document describes a home agent-assisted route optimization functionality for the IPv4 Network Mobility Protocol.  The function is designed to facilitate optimal routing in cases where all nodes are connected to a single home agent; thus, the use case is route optimization within a single organization or similar entity.  The functionality enables the discovery of eligible peer nodes (based on information received from the home agent) and their network prefixes, and the establishment of a direct tunnel between such nodes.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>
