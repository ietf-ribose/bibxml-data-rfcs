      <t>This document describes the MOBIKE protocol, a mobility and multihoming extension to Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2).  MOBIKE allows the IP addresses associated with IKEv2 and tunnel mode IPsec Security Associations to change.  A mobile Virtual Private Network (VPN) client could use MOBIKE to keep the connection with the VPN gateway active while moving from one address to another.  Similarly, a multihomed host could use MOBIKE to move the traffic to a different interface if, for instance, the one currently being used stops working. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
