    <abstract>Traversal of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the sessions it establishes through Network Address Translators (NATs) is a complex problem.  Currently, there are many deployment scenarios and traversal mechanisms for media traffic.  This document provides concrete recommendations and a unified method for NAT traversal as well as documents corresponding flows.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
