    <abstract>IPsec offers much promise as a secure remote access mechanism.  However, there are a number of differing remote access scenarios, each having some shared and some unique requirements.  A thorough understanding of these requirements is necessary in order to effectively evaluate the suitability of a specific set of mechanisms for any particular remote access scenario.  This document enumerates the requirements for a number of common remote access scenarios.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
