    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an authentication service that uses the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as a transport method to carry the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). As such, it defines an EAP lower layer based on CoAP called "CoAP-EAP". One of the main goals is to authenticate a CoAP-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) device (EAP peer) that intends to join a security domain managed by a Controller (EAP authenticator). Secondly, it allows deriving key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between them based on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling the establishment of a security association between them.</t>
