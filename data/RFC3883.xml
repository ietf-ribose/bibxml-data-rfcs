    <abstract>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.  OSPF behavior over demand circuits (DC) is optimized in RFC 1793 to minimize the amount of overhead traffic.  A part of the OSPF demand circuit extensions is the Hello suppression mechanism.  This technique allows a demand circuit to go down when no interesting traffic is going through the link.  However, it also introduces a problem, where it becomes impossible to detect an OSPF-inactive neighbor over such a link.  This memo introduces a new mechanism called "neighbor probing" to address the above problem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
