    <abstract>
      <t>Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) provides a means of attesting the identity of a telephone caller via a signed token in order to prevent impersonation of a calling party number, which is a key enabler for illegal robocalling. Similar impersonation is sometimes leveraged by bad actors in the text and multimedia messaging space. This document explores the applicability of STIR's Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) and certificate issuance framework to text and multimedia messaging use cases, including support for both messages carried as a payload in SIP requests and messages sent in sessions negotiated by SIP.</t>
