    <abstract>This document provides the network management framework for the Transport Profile for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP). This framework relies on the management terminology from the ITU-T to describe the management architecture that could be used for an MPLS-TP management network. The management of the MPLS-TP network could be based on multi-tiered distributed management systems. This document provides a description of the network and element management architectures that could be applied and also describes heuristics associated with fault, configuration, and performance aspects of the management system. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</abstract>
