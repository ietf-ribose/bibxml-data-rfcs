    <abstract>RFC 6155 specifies an extension for the HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol, allowing the use of an IP address and port number to request a Device location based on an individual packet flow. However, certain kinds of NAT require that identifiers for both ends of the packet flow must be specified in order to unambiguously satisfy the location request. This document specifies an XML Schema and a URN Sub-Namespace for a Flow Identity Extension for HELD to support this requirement. This document updates RFC 6155 by deprecating the port number elements specified therein.</abstract>
