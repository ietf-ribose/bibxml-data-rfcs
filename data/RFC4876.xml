    <abstract>
      <t>This document consists of two primary components, a schema for agents that make use of the Lightweight Directory Access protocol (LDAP) and a proposed use case of that schema, for distributed configuration of similar directory user agents.  A set of attribute types and an object class are proposed.  In the proposed use case, directory user agents (DUAs) can use this schema to determine directory data location and access parameters for specific services they support.  In addition, in the proposed use case, attribute and object class mapping allows DUAs to reconfigure their expected (default) schema to match that of the end user's environment.  This document is intended to be a skeleton for future documents that describe configuration of specific DUA services.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
