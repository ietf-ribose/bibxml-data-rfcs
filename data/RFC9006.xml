    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides guidance on how to implement and use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in Constrained-Node Networks (CNNs), which are a characteristic of the Internet of Things (IoT).  Such environments require a lightweight TCP implementation and may not make use of optional functionality.  This document explains a number of known and deployed techniques to simplify a TCP stack as well as corresponding trade-offs.  The objective is to help embedded developers with decisions on which TCP features to use.</t>
