    <abstract>This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to allow the client to read the target entry of an update operation.  The client may request to read the entry before and/or after the modifications are applied.  These reads are done as an atomic part of the update operation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
