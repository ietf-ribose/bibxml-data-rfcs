    <abstract>The triple-DES (3DES) and RC4 encryption types are steadily weakening in cryptographic strength, and the deprecation process should begin for their use in Kerberos.  Accordingly, RFC 4757 has been moved to Historic status, as none of the encryption types it specifies should be used, and RFC 3961 has been updated to note the deprecation of the triple-DES encryption types.  RFC 4120 is likewise updated to remove the recommendation to implement triple-DES encryption and checksum types.</abstract>
