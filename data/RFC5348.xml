    <abstract>This document specifies TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). TFRC is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet environment. It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for applications such as streaming media where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance. This document obsoletes RFC 3448 and updates RFC 4342. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</abstract>
