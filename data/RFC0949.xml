    <abstract>There are various contexts in which it would be desirable to have an FTP command that had the effect of the present STOR but rather than requiring the sender to specify a file name istead caused the resultant file to have a unique name relative to the current directory.  This RFC proposes an extension to the File Transfer Protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  See RFC-959.</abstract>
