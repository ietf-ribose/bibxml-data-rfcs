    <abstract>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides support for flow-level multipathing for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology.  Active-active access at the TRILL edge is the extension of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus as discussed in RFC 7379.  In this document, the edge RBridge (Routing Bridge, or TRILL switch) group providing active-active access to such an end station is represented as a virtual RBridge.  Based on the concept of the virtual RBridge, along with its pseudo-nickname, this document specifies a method for TRILL active-active access by such end stations.</abstract>
