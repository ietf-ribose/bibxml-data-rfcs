    <abstract>
      <t>This RFC provides the common definitions for the structure and identification of management information for TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, together with its companion memos, which describe the initial management information base along with the initial network management protocol, these documents provide a simple, working architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets and in particular, the Internet.  This memo specifies a draft standard for the Internet community.  TCP/IP implementation in the Internet which are network manageable are expected to adopt and implement this specification.</t>
