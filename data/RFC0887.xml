      <t>This RFC specifies a draft standard for the ARPA Internet community.  It describes a resource location protocol for use in the ARPA Internet.  It is most useful on networks employing technologies which support some method of broadcast addressing, however it may also be used on other types of networks.  For maximum benefit, all hosts which provide significant resources or services to other hosts on the Internet should implement this protocol.  Hosts failing to implement the Resource Location Protocol risk being ignored by other hosts which are attempting to locate resources on the Internet.</t>
