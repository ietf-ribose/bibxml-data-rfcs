    <abstract>This document reports the outcome of a workshop held by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on Unwanted Internet Traffic.  The workshop was held on March 9-10, 2006 at USC/ISI in Marina del Rey, CA, USA.  The primary goal of the workshop was to foster interchange between the operator, standards, and research communities on the topic of unwanted traffic, as manifested in, for example, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, spam, and phishing, to gain understandings on the ultimate sources of these unwanted traffic, and to assess their impact and the effectiveness of existing solutions.  It was also a goal of the workshop to identify engineering and research topics that could be undertaken by the IAB, the IETF, the IRTF, and the network research and development community at large to develop effective countermeasures against the unwanted traffic.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
