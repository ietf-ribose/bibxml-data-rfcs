    <abstract>In the Split Network Virtualization Edge (Split-NVE) architecture, the functions of the NVE are split across a server and a piece of external network equipment that is called an "External NVE". The server-resident control-plane functionality resides in control software, which may be part of hypervisor or container-management software; for simplicity, this document refers to the hypervisor as the "location" of this software. One or more control-plane protocols between a hypervisor and its associated External NVE(s) are used by the hypervisor to distribute its virtual-machine networking state to the External NVE(s) for further handling. This document illustrates the functionality required by this type of control-plane signaling protocol and outlines the high-level requirements. Virtual-machine states as well as state transitioning are summarized to help clarify the protocol requirements.</abstract>
