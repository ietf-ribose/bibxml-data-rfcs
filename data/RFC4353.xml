    <abstract>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation, modification, and termination of media sessions between user agents.  These sessions are managed by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIP relationship between a pair of user agents.  Because dialogs are between pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party communications (such as a phone call), is obvious.  Communications sessions with multiple participants, generally known as conferencing, are more complicated.  This document defines a framework for how such conferencing can occur.  This framework describes the overall architecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for multi-party conferencing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</abstract>
