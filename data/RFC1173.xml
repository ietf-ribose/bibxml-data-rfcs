    <abstract>This informational RFC describes the conventions to be followed by those in charge of networks and hosts in the Internet.  It is a summary of the "oral tradition" of the Internet on this subject. [RFC Editor's note: This memo is a contribution by the author of his view of these conventions.  It is expected that this RFC will provide a basis for the development of official policies in the future.] These conventions may be supplemented or amended by the policies of specific local and regional components of the Internet.  This RFC does not specify a standard, or a policy of the IAB.</abstract>
