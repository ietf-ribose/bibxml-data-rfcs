      <t>This memo describes the results gathered from testing NETBLT over three networks of different bandwidths and round-trip delays.  The results are not complete, but the information gathered so far has not been promising.  The NETBLT protocol is specified in RFC-998; this document assumes an understanding of the specification as described in RFC-998.</t>
